I am dreaming of an Emacs major mode to interact with my repos.

I am thinking of something that, when invoked, would:

 1. run `mr status` against a given `.mrconfig` (~/.mrconfig, by
    default, see [processes](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Processes.html))

 2. for reach repo, create a [button](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Buttons.html) that, when clicked, would
    fire an action ([magit](https://magit.vc/) maybe? or some [project.el](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Projects.html) thing?
    possibly some keybindings for each?)

 3. add a [keymap](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Keymaps.html) for the mode that would allow calling `mr update` (or
    whatever?) on all (or marked?) repos

 4. possibly hide some parts of the `mr status` output
    (e.g. [invisible text](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Invisible-Text.html), challenge here is to tell the mr output
    from git (possibly with [overlays](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Overlays.html)?)

I think the MVP is basically step 1 and 2 above, with something that
drops me in the repo on "enter". See also [this guide](https://systemcrafters.net/learning-emacs-lisp/creating-minor-modes/).

Bonus points for a "redacted" mode that calls `mr -j$NCPU -m status`
for a "only relevant" view.

Previous art:

 * [multi-magit](https://github.com/luismbo/multi-magit): third-party, not in Debian, not accepted in magit either
 * [magit repository list](https://magit.vc/manual/magit/Repository-List.html): a bit clunky, slow, needs a list of
   repo, maybe we could feed myrepos list in there?
