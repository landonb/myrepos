If I understand correctly, you have multiple repositories that are organised in a certain way and you want to run status checks for a certain set of repos, but not necessarily all the repos in a single set are under one single directory. If so, [this earlier thread](https://myrepos.branchable.com/forum/How_to_work_on_a_specific_subset_of_repos__63__/) seems similar to what you want and it seems there I suggested exactly what you are doing, but now I see that the code unconditionally loads the primary `~/.mrconfig` file. So, until a better way to do this gets added, I think what you need is to rename `~/.mrconfig` to `~/.mrconfig-global`, make it include your other mr config files, and then use `-c ~/.mrconfig-global` but when you want a different set of repos, you can use `-c` with the mr config file for the other set. Instead of using `-c`, you could also make `~/.mrconfig` a symlink to a mr config file for your \"current\" subset of repos.
